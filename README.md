## About  project
* Topic: **FORECASTING THE CURRENCY PRICE**
* Purpose:
  - Developed and evaluated several models for forecasting currency price:
    - GBP (Great British Pound)
    - EUR (Euro)
    - JPY (Japanese Yen)
  - Eight models used are Linear Regression, ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (ETS), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Stacking Model and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Model evaluation metrics: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE),  Mean Absolute Error (MAE),  Mean Percentage Absolute Error (MAPE)
